         <p>Pizza club was prototyped as a mobile web app at Cal Poly's 2015 Hackathon, and won the Best Design award.</p>

         <p>Pizza Club is a secret "meta" club at Cal Poly, which relies on signing up for every Cal Poly club with a fake email address and using the messages received to let members know when free pizza is available on campus.</p>

         <p>Information about the closest upcoming pizza event is only available for 6 people to claim. After claiming this information (deemed as "slices" in our app), users are able to see the location where the pizza is being shared. This makes the interaction with our app fast paced and competitive to get free food.</p>

         <p>Users who have claimed slices can then review their experience after the event is over by writing about it and by selecting characterized pizza icons representing their emotions with the food and club meeting.</p>

         <p>Pizza Club humorously exploits the exceedingly large amount of free food offered on campus, while also encouraging people to go to clubs they maybe would have previously not gone to, increasing their worldviews and life experiences. </p>

         <p>My team was awesome. I had the initial concept and did frontend. <a href="http://massimo.siboldi.com/" target="_blank">Massimo Siboldi</a> did backend and frontend. <a href="http://kdodgedesign.com/" target="_blank">Kelsey Dodge</a> did the amazing icons. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=535002436" target="_blank">Chris Taylor</a> did mockups and visual assets. <a href="http://emilygwang.com/" target="_blank">Emily Wang</a> did interface design.</p>

         <p>I don't even really like pizza.</p>
