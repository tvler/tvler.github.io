         <p>KCPR is Cal Poly's student run radio station. My second year being a DJ, I applied for the General Manager position and got hired. Here is what I accomplished in that year:</p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Organized and ran weekly meetings with KCPR executive staff members</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">I set up timeframes, discussion topics, and deliverable material for weekly meeting consisting of my executive team. I also was the first general manager of KCPR to advertise attending the executive meetings to any DJ in the station, in an effort to keep our politics open and friendly.</p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Organized and ran three meetings a quarter with all currently active DJs (60+ students and community members)</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">These meetings (called general meetings) are a required 90 minute brief to all active DJs on what the station has been up to since the last general meeting. Executive staff share their current projects, and use the large audience to look for any DJ willing to help. It was my duty to keep these meeting organized yet also interesting and fun for the attendees. </p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Attended Journalism Department meetings on focusing the "mission statement" of the major to better fit with new consumer technologies and trends</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">The mission statement for the Journalism Department isn’t a static goal. As the journalism industry proceeds with new technologies, mediums, and audiences, the department needs to work with these changes and decide what its students need to learn at our school. My main discussion points were that radio and audio stories have taken a resurgence as a style of long-form/narrative journalism, and that students who wish to publish pieces like this should consider making audio stories rather than written or video publications.</p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Organized our annual pledge drive, involving directing the prodction of a new section of our website where we integrated a direct Paypal donation tool</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">In my term before general manager of KCPR, I was the business director of the station. One of my first actions was to expand our annual pledge drive from being a phone and mail-in donation event into a kickstarter campaign. Online donation was a huge success, and we raised more than 2x our funding goal. As general manager, we refined this process. My larger reach over the executive team allowed me to coordinate with out internet director to engineer our own locally hosted donations page via paypal. Although we did not make as much initial money through donations, my improvements made us actually more money than the kickstarter campaign.</p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Directed marketing and graphic design to promote our pledge drive to our audience and the community</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">Our marketing strategy had three main branches: social media marketing, making shareable video, and physical poster distribution. I organized a team of DJs with graphic design experience to create both digital and physical content to promote our event.</p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Converted our physical library of audio public service announcements into a digital cloud-based library</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">Our public service announcement audio library had been recorded onto the humorously outdated “MiniDisc” format. I was able to organize our Traffic Director to convert all the PSAs into digital files, to be streamable from our mixboard’s software. As well as being easier for DJs to play the PSAs, it also allowed for a faster pace of production for the audio clips, as DJs wouldn’t have to deal with clunkiness of burning the files to a physical format.</p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Directed the creation of four quarterly airtime schedules</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">Every quarter KCPR’s schedule is completely flushed and reorganized again, mostly due to a large amount of DJs having different academic calendars. This is a huge effort of organizing 50+ DJs to submit their available airtimes, reviewing our documentation of their past on-air quality, and using that information to create a precedence table of fitting everyone into times that would work best for them.</p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Organized four 10 week long classes for incoming DJs to learn the infrastructure of the radio station</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">In order to become a DJ at KCPR, applicants will need to fill out a music and interests questionnaire, and attend an in-person interview. Behind the scenes, this consists of hours of discussion on what would be the most applicable content for the paper questionnaire, and over 12 hours of interviewing ~60 potential applicants. Concluding this, we let about ~10% of all applicants in a quarter.</p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Expanded KCPR’s on-campus audience, by streaming in the UU plaza, the health center, and becoming an audio channel at the Cal Poly Rec Center</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">Before my term KCPR wasn’t streamed anywhere on campus. The music playing at the UU was only decided by the current UU front-desk workers choosing a Pandora station. We believed that getting our station to broadcast on our campus would be better for the Cal Poly atmosphere. Our station is now streaming in 3 locations on campus.</p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Oversaw and directed a complete redesign of KCPR’s website, using the javascript application framework AngularJS</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">I led a computer science DJ to restructure our whole app to use a single-page javascript application framework. This was beneficial for us because we could have our radio streaming in the background between pageloads, instead of having the audio stop on navigating to a different page or using a clunky popup. I also played the role as the middle man with discussing iterations on his design and copy decisions to my executive staff. </p>
         <br/>
         <p><i class="right-job"></i>Evolved the General Manager role into becoming a paid position within the Journalism Department for future position holders</p>
         <p class="resume-desc single-job">To integrate my position even closer with the journalism department, I was part of the planning committee to establish my position as a paid position. The journalism department turned to me to figure out how to gauge the hours I worked, the time frame I worked, and other procedural information on my position.</p>
