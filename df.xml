<p>Sam Wood, reporting for The Philadelphia Inquirer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The city Health Department, which has had a long-standing policy
of keeping restaurant inspection reports secret for 30 days,
announced Monday that it will move to publicly post the reports
&#8220;as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The change follows an <a href="http://mobile.philly.com/beta?wss=/philly/health/special_reports/clean-plates&amp;id=334308301">Inquirer/Philly.com report</a> that found
Philadelphia was the only major city in the United States to
withhold its inspection results from the public for any
significant length of time.</p>

<p>The 30-day delay meant that diners could unknowingly patronize
restaurants cited for serious hygiene problems.</p>

<p>In late February, nearly 100 lawyers and law students became
violently ill after attending a banquet at Joy Tsin Lau in
Chinatown. Several were treated in local emergency rooms.
Seventeen days before the banquet, the restaurant had been cited
by the health department for five serious risk factors for
food-borne illness, and was deemed to have &#8220;unacceptable public
health or food-safety conditions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This policy change seems obvious when put in such stark terms, but to me it shows the power and importance of strong local newspapers (regardless of whether they&#8217;re printed on actual paper).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s Daisey&#8217;s deep conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is possible we will look back in a decade and know we couldn’t
have seen that this was the moment of Peak Apple because it is
always clearer in retrospect when something is past its peak.</p>

<p>Time will tell. It always does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brilliant.</p>

<p>But the serious problem is that The Guardian ran this piece (in the Tech section, not Opinion, no less) without any sort of note alluding to the fact that Mike Daisey <a href="https://daringfireball.net/s/mike+daisey">is a known fabulist</a> who completely made up <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/16/dramatic-license">stories</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/16/this-american-life-mike-daisey">about labor abuses</a> in Apple&#8217;s Chinese supply chain.</p>

<p>Mike Daisey doesn&#8217;t have zero credibility regarding Apple &#8212; he has <em>negative</em> credibility. He&#8217;s a liar.</p>

<p>Shame on The Guardian.</p>

<p>David Gewirtz&#8217;s review of the new Apple TV is rather scathing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be blunt, the new remote is terrible. Swiping isn&#8217;t nearly as
accurate at lean-back distances and as a game controller, it&#8217;s
mediocre at best. I found it very frustrating attempting to select
items. Rubbing a finger (usually a thumb) across the trackpad
surface invariably selected the wrong item or overshot what I was
aiming for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely disagree with this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s very difficult to tell top from bottom on the remote. It&#8217;s
almost entirely symmetrical, and the only difference is the top is
less shiny, the surface you&#8217;re supposed to use as a touch surface.
In the dark, I expect people will be pushing the wrong buttons and
talking into the wrong end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree with this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where is Safari? We have a touch screen remote, why not a browser?
After all, even the Wii had a browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wii has a <em>terrible</em> browser that no one uses. It&#8217;s possible that Safari for Apple TV will come in a software update, but I think complaining about this is like complaining about the lack of a floppy drive on the original iMac, or that the iPhone needed Flash Player.</p>

<p>Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google SVP for Android, Chrome OS, and Chromecast:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the last few days, there’s been some confusion about the future of Chrome OS and Chromebooks based on speculation that Chrome OS will be folded into Android. While we’ve been working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems, there&#8217;s no plan to phase out Chrome OS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take that as you will, but to me it reads as a non-denial denial.</p>

<p>Alistair Barr, reporting for the WSJ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google engineers have been working for roughly two years to combine the operating systems and have made progress recently, two of the people said. The company plans to unveil its new, single operating system in 2017, but expects to show off an early version next year, one of the people said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this was inevitable. Android can (and does) run Chrome. Chrome can&#8217;t run Android. And the browser-based web is decreasing in importance.</p>

<p>Roger Moore, writing for The Guardian:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sad fact is that I know exactly how to make a dry martini but
I can’t drink them because, two years ago, I discovered I was
diabetic. I prefer one with gin, but James Bond liked a vodka
martini, “shaken not stirred” &#8212; which I never said, by the way.
That was Sean Connery, remember him?</p>

<p>The worst martini I’ve ever had was in a club in New Zealand,
where the barman poured juice from a bottle of olives into the
vodka. That’s called a dirty martini and it is a dirty, filthy,
rotten martini, and should not be drunk by anybody except
condemned prisoners.</p>

<p>My dry martinis taste amazing and the day they tell me I’ve got 24
hours to live I am going to have six. Here’s how I make them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moore&#8217;s recipe should please you gin aficionados who always email me to complain when I link to <a href="http://www.coudal.com/perfect.php">Jim Coudal&#8217;s recipe</a>. Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend Moore&#8217;s recipe &#8212; you need significant stirring, and there&#8217;s no need to put the cocktail shaker in the freezer. But I found Moore&#8217;s affection for martinis, and the poignancy of his inability now to drink them, irresistible.</p>

<p>I missed this from back in April:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sony offered James Bond star Daniel Craig a $5 million fee to put
the forthcoming Sony Xperia Z4 smartphone in the forthcoming film
<em>Spectre</em>, but Craig and <em>Spectre</em> director Sam Mendes resisted
because &#8220;James Bond only uses the &#8216;best.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Craig and Mendes had concerns other than cash, it seems from that
second email.</p>

<p>&#8220;BEYOND the $$ factor, there is, as you may know, a CREATIVE
factor whereby Sam and Daniel don’t like the Sony phone for the
film (the thinking, subjectively/objectively is that James Bond
only uses the &#8216;best,&#8217; and in their minds, the Sony phone is not
the &#8216;best&#8217;),&#8221; wrote Andrew Gumpert, President of Worldwide
Business Affairs and Operations for Columbia Pictures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems pretty obvious which phone Bond ought to be using.</p>

  <p>Previous Apple TVs had a solution in the form of the Remote app,
which let you use your iPhone&#8217;s virtual keyboard to enter any text
you might need to type. Unfortunately, that app has yet to see an
update that supports the fourth-generation Apple TV.</p>

<p>Nor can the new Apple TV connect to a Bluetooth keyboard &#8212; it
just doesn&#8217;t show up in the Bluetooth menu &#8212; so you are, as of
now, completely confined to one-letter-at-a-time text entry.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really need to say it, but I&#8217;m going to: Apple, this
sucks. It&#8217;s so easy to set up the Apple TV with an iPhone; why
can&#8217;t there be an option for all password prompts bounce over to a
nearby unlocked iOS device? Or, barring that &#8212; give us an update
to Remote app. Or a Bluetooth keyboard. This is painful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s also pretty frustrating that you can only log into one Game Center account at a time. That seems downright wrong for a shared family device. I can only guess that a lot these seemingly obvious things are just the usual low-hanging fruit that doesn&#8217;t make it in to a 1.0 release.</p>

<p>Abdel Ibrahim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet, despite it not being a hobby, it’s still going to be
connected via HDMI 2 on most of our televisions, something even
Eddy Cue admits. Of course, the major reason for this is because
Apple has yet to announce their own television service to go along
with their box. If and when they announce such a service, that’s
when we can expect Apple TV to start utilizing HDMI 1.</p>

<p>I believe the new box, and the soon-to-be streaming service, is a
setup to start selling a true Apple television in the coming
years. What makes me feel this way? The iMac. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>I know what you’re thinking. “The TV business is horrible. There
are no margins there!” That may be true, but guess what? There
are no margins in the PC or smartphone business either. The
margins only go to those who are making premium products with an
OS they own and control. And guess who does that better than
anyone? Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ibrahim&#8217;s point about the new Apple TV not being &#8220;HDMI 1&#8221; is a strong one. But that&#8217;s more about Apple&#8217;s long-rumored, supposedly-still-in-the-works content streaming service than about making actual TV sets. (To be clear, Ibrahim is talking about Input 1 on your TV, not a version number or spec for HDMI. For most people their cable box or DVR remains Input 1.)</p>

<p>But 4K is an interesting opportunity. If 4K takes off, that means there&#8217;s an upgrade cycle coming for everyone with 720p/1080p HD TVs. That would be the time for Apple to make an iMac-style all-in-one TV set.</p>

<p>Speaking of Christina Warren, here&#8217;s her review of the new Apple TV:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, let&#8217;s be clear &#8212; this whole talking to the TV thing isn&#8217;t
new. Amazon did it first with the Fire TV more than 18 months ago.</p>

<p>But what makes the Apple approach different is, out of the box,
Siri works with more than just iTunes. It works with Hulu, HBO (Go
and Now), Showtime (and Showtime Anytime) and Netflix &#8212; with more
support coming soon. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>The Siri search function that works across apps also means that
when you search for content that is available on more than one
source, you can choose the source you want to use.</p>

<p>If I search for <em>Scandal</em>, I&#8217;ll see the episodes available on
Netflix (Seasons 1 through 4), the stuff available on Hulu (Season
5) and the stuff on iTunes. Again, because this works out of the
box with the major content sources, this instantly makes finding
what you want to watch <em>way</em> easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#8217;ll all take it for granted soon, but right now, it just feels fun to search for things on Apple TV. What&#8217;s nice is that the search results prioritize &#8220;free&#8221; &#8212; if you can watch a movie or show without paying anything more, that will be the first option.</p>

<p>Brian Stelter, writing for CNN Money:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About 40 writers, producers and editors will be affected by the
decision. Writers who have contracts will be honored. Some will
continue to write for ESPN&#8217;s website and produce videos for the
ESPN Films unit.</p>

<p>But an unknown number of others will be leaving. Some of the
site&#8217;s most distinctive work, like its television show recaps and
features about movies, will be going away.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting out of the pop culture business,&#8221; the senior ESPN
source said.</p>

<p>ESPN executives are meeting with the affected staffers on Friday
afternoon. Michael Baumann, a freelancer, complained that he found
out about the closure through Twitter, not from the company
directly.</p>

<p>Speaking of quantifying the beverages consumed by James Bond, Futility Closet has an excerpt from Ben MacIntyre&#8217;s 2008 book, <em>For Your Eyes Only: Ian Fleming and James Bond</em>, listing all 46 drinks Bond consumed in Fleming&#8217;s 11th novel, <em>On Her Majesty’s Secret Service</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to one Bondologist, these include: unspecified
quantities of Pouilly-Fuissé white wine, Taittinger champagne,
Mouton Rothschild ’53 claret, calvados, Krug champagne, three
bourbons with water, four vodka and tonics, two double brandy
and ginger ales, two whisky and sodas, three double vodka
martinis, two double bourbons on the rocks, at least one glass
of neat whisky, a flask of Enzian schnapps, Marsala wine, the
better part of a bottle of fiery Algerian wine (served by M),
two more Scotch whiskies, half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon, a
Jack Daniel’s Tennessee whisky with water, on the rocks, a
bottle of Riquewihr wine, four steins of Franziskaner beer, and
a double Steinhäger gin.</p>

<p>Another interview, this one with TimeOut:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: <em>Do you care who plays Bond after you?</em></p>

<p>A: Look, I don’t give a fuck. Good luck to them! All I care about
   is that if I stop doing these things we’ve left it in a good
   place and people pick it up and make it better. Make it better,
   that’s all.</p>

<p>Q: <em>You won’t be backseat-driving then?</em></p>

<p>A: Oh Christ, no. How fucking sad would that be? “Oh look, it’s
   Daniel Craig, he’s on set again!” No!</p>

<p>Q: <em>If an actor was offered Bond and came to you looking for
   advice, what would you say to him &#8212; or her?</em></p>

<p>A: Literally I’d say two things. Firstly, it’s your decision.
   Don’t listen to anybody else. Well, do listen to everybody, but
   you have to make the choice at the end of the day. It’s your
   bed to lie on. And don’t be shit! <em>Don’t be shit.</em> You’ve got to
   step up. People do not make movies like this any more. This is
   really rare now. So don’t be shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that Craig does not relish the press tours that accompany the release of a new Bond movie, but I appreciate that he doesn&#8217;t just phone in his interviews with empty platitudes.</p>

<p>Terrific behind-the-scenes piece by Lance Ulanoff, with extensive interviews with Phil Schiller and John Ternus (VP of Mac and iPad engineering):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the cloud looms larger, will the hardware we use still matter?
Schiller rejects this notion.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. 1, the importance and value of great hardware has not
diminished in any way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Across the board, our goal is to
make the best in the categories we choose to compete in. It&#8217;s what
we&#8217;re doing and it&#8217;s reflected in customers choosing our products
over anyone else&#8217;s. So I do think people are showing with their
choice that they do value quality and beauty of the hardware and
that is not diminishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never heard anyone say, ‘Because I like to keep my stuff
in the cloud, I will take a cheap piece of hardware and I want it
to be ugly.&#8217; All things being equal, of course, nobody wants
that,&#8221; Schiller said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s a blockbuster piece, truly a must-read. Here&#8217;s a bit with Ternus on fit-and-finish:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, Apple is apparently taking the time to custom-fit all
sorts of pieces in the MacBook through a process it calls
&#8220;binning.&#8221; Since there can be minuscule variances that might make,
for instance, the Force Touch trackpad not a perfect fit for the
body or the super-thin Retina display not exactly a match for the
top of the case, Apple finds matching parts from the production
line. Even the thickness of the stainless steel Apple Logo, which
replaced the backlit logo on previous MacBook models, can vary by
a micron or so, meaning Apple needs to find a top with the right
cutout depth. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>The result is that every MacBook is, in a way, special and
imperceptibly different. I joked that every MacBook is like a
Cabbage Patch Kid. &#8220;Every one is unique,&#8221; I said. Ternus finished
the thought: &#8220;all in an effort to make them the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an almost unprecedented attention to detail. And with each
successive generation of Mac, Apple is getting better at it.</p>

<p>Dan Frommer, at Quartz:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple shipped 48 million iPhones last quarter, up 22%
year-over-year. iPhones represented 63% of Apple’s overall
revenue, about the same as last quarter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s no question that the iPhone warps Apple&#8217;s financials. But consider this: Apple&#8217;s non-iPhone business generated around $75-80 billion for the just-completed 2015 fiscal year.</p>

<p>Apple press release:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2015 fourth
quarter ended September 26, 2015. The Company posted quarterly
revenue of $51.5 billion and quarterly net profit of $11.1
billion, or $1.96 per diluted share. These results compare to
revenue of $42.1 billion and net profit of $8.5 billion, or $1.42
per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 39.9
percent compared to 38 percent in the year-ago quarter.
International sales accounted for 62 percent of the quarter’s
revenue.</p>

<p>The growth was fueled by record fourth quarter sales of iPhone,
the expanded availability of Apple Watch, and all-time records for
Mac sales and revenue from services.</p>

<p>“Fiscal 2015 was Apple’s most successful year ever, with revenue
growing 28% to nearly $234 billion. This continued success is the
result of our commitment to making the best, most innovative
products on earth, and it’s a testament to the tremendous
execution by our teams,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most profitable company on the planet today, and revenue and profit are still growing at around 30 percent annually.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to lose sight of what that sort of growth means. Here&#8217;s an example, though: five years ago, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/01/25Apple-Reports-First-Quarter-Results.html">Steve Jobs was impressed that Apple had grown to become a company with $50 billion in <em>annual</em> revenue</a>.</p>

<p>Tasneem Nashrulla, reporting for BuzzFeed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BuzzFeed plans to withdraw its participation from the South by
Southwest Interactive festival after organizers <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mbvd/sxsw-cancels-gaming-panels-over-numerous-threats-of-on-site">decided</a> to
cancel two gaming and online harassment panels after receiving
“numerous threats of on-site violence.”</p>

<p>In a letter to the organizers of the Austin-based media festival
sent Tuesday, President of BuzzFeed Motion Pictures Ze Frank,
BuzzFeed Publisher Dao Nguyen, and BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben
Smith wrote, “We will feel compelled to withdraw … if the
conference can’t find a way to do what those other targets of
harassment do every day &#8212; to carry on important conversations in
the face of harassment.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I sympathize with SXSW &#8212; these threats have to be taken seriously. But canceling anti-harassment panels because of harassing threats &#8212; that&#8217;s just <a href="https://twitter.com/gte/status/658788898018074624">wrong</a>.</p>

<p>Fascinating story with excellent interactive design from The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The midnight sun still gleamed at 1 a.m. across the brilliant
expanse of the Greenland ice sheet. Brandon Overstreet, a doctoral
candidate in hydrology at the University of Wyoming, picked his
way across the frozen landscape, clipped his climbing harness to
an anchor in the ice and crept toward the edge of a river that
rushed downstream toward an enormous sinkhole.</p>

<p>If he fell in, “the death rate is 100 percent,” said Mr.
Overstreet’s friend and fellow researcher, Lincoln Pitcher.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The video footage from their drones is simply amazing.</p>

<p>Jason Del Rey, reporting for Recode:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gordon Smith, Chase’s CEO of consumer and community banking, made
the announcement at the Money20/20 payments conference in Las
Vegas on Monday. In a video outlining the new product, Chase
showed shoppers paying in stores by displaying a QR code to the
cashier, not by tapping and paying through NFC technology like
Apple Pay and Android Pay. The video also shows a diner paying at
a restaurant by taking a photo of the bill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing involving QR codes has ever taken off. Good job wasting time on this, Chase.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A few points in response to feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>QR codes are huge in China.</em> Who cares? Chase isn&#8217;t a Chinese bank. Chase Pay is for the United States.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Starbucks has had great success with their code-scanner system.</em> OK, that&#8217;s a good data point. Touché. I still say it stinks, though &#8212; <a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/08/apple-pay-will-soon-work-at-starbucks/">and Apple Pay is coming soon</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Snapchat uses QR codes. Boarding passes for airlines and trains are usually QR codes.</em> Not going to help Chase Pay. Boarding passes in particular: the QR code scanning is so flaky that most of the TSE checkpoints I&#8217;ve gone through recently require you to place your phone face down on their scanner.</p></li>
<li><p><em>When you pair your Apple Watch with your iPhone using the camera, that animation on the watch face is just a fancy equivalent of a QR code.</em> Sure, I agree &#8212; but I&#8217;ve gone through that pairing process at least half a dozen times, with multiple watches and OS restores, and in my experience it can be so flaky that it doesn&#8217;t work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I admit it was hyperbole to say that nothing involving QR codes has taken off &#8212; but I think it&#8217;s fair to say that nothing involving QR codes results in a good experience.</p>

<p>Emil Protoalinski, writing for VentureBeat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pitch is simple: Kangaroo offers the power of a cheap
full-sized computer with the convenience and mobility of a cell
phone. The black satin aluminum device is powered by an Intel
Cherrytrail (Z8500) SOC, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage (only about
18GB is free when you first start it, but storage is expandable
via a microSD card), and an on-board battery (up to four hours
of “casual use”). The standalone Kangaroo Dock, which you can
swap out for other future docks, includes an HDMI port and two
USB ports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheap isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> interesting. Small isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> interesting. But really cheap and really small at the same time &#8212; that seems interesting to me.</p>

<p>Variety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After racking up the year’s best per-screen average in its opening
weekend and doing strong business in limited expansion, <em>Steve
Jobs</em> hit a stumbling block in its national release. It debuted to
a measly $7.3 million, only a little more than the $6.7 million
that <em>Jobs</em>, a critically derided film about the iPhone father
with Ashton Kutcher, made in its initial weekend. Going into the
weekend, some tracking suggested that the picture would do as much
as $19 million.</p>

<p>So what went wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s talk that word-of-mouth will help, but I think otherwise. It&#8217;s a movie about a man&#8217;s strained relationship with his daughter. That&#8217;s not what people should or do expect from a film titled <em>Steve Jobs</em>.</p>

<p>Ari Grant, iOS engineering manager for Facebook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second issue is with how we manage audio sessions. If you
leave the Facebook app after watching a video, the audio session
sometimes stays open as if the app was playing audio silently.
This is similar to when you close a music app and want to keep
listening to the music while you do other things, except in this
case it was unintentional and nothing kept playing. The app isn&#8217;t
actually doing anything while awake in the background, but it does
use more battery simply by being awake. Our fixes will solve this
audio issue and remove background audio completely.</p>

<p>The issues we have found are not caused by the optional Location
History feature in the Facebook app or anything related to
location. If you haven&#8217;t opted into this feature by setting
Location Access to Always and enabling Location History inside the
app, then we aren&#8217;t accessing your device&#8217;s location in the
background. The issues described above don&#8217;t change this at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is in response to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-background-data-and-battery-usage-of-facebooks-ios-app/">widespread complaints that Facebook&#8217;s iPhone app was consuming inordinate battery life in the background</a> &#8212; even when background updates were turned off. The suspicion was that Facebook was doing this deliberately, to work around iOS&#8217;s background processing restrictions. I&#8217;m curious to see how these bug fixes change things for Facebook users.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Via Twitter, a few DF <a href="https://twitter.com/_Peter_A_/status/658762067298619392">readers</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tommertron/status/658759013111341058">claim</a> that the new version of the Facebook app <a href="https://twitter.com/TRezendes/status/658835075732213760">still</a> consumes a lot of energy in the background, even with background refresh disabled in Settings: General: Background App Refresh.

<p>Speaking of ill-considered ad campaigns, this one from Airbnb pretty much boggles the mind. It&#8217;s so bad that when the ads started going up, most people thought they were part of a propaganda compaign from an anti-Airbnb group, not Airbnb itself.</p>

<p>Ken Segall, on a stupid new ad campaign:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even more amazing, four companies happily signed up for the
effort: Dell, HP, Intel and Lenovo. (Hereafter referred to as
“co-conspirators.”) It boggles the mind that at least one person
in each of these four PC companies (and likely far more) thought
this was a good strategy. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>The goal was to dial up the PC lust factor by screaming that PCs
can do things other devices can’t. And what better way to do this
than come up with a catch phrase: “PC does what?” And for extra
catchy-ness, the line can be shouted instead of spoken.</p>

<p>Good idea, except (A) it’s not catchy, and (B) it’s embarrassingly
awkward.</p>

<p>The desperation is palpable.</p>

<p>Walt Mossberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1941, the brilliant writer and director Orson Welles made a
movie loosely based on a famous, powerful, contemporary American
business figure &#8212; the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst
&#8212; that showed him in a bad light. He took artistic liberties with
the character. But he didn&#8217;t call the movie <em>Citizen Hearst</em>. He
called it <em>Citizen Kane</em>, and it&#8217;s now regarded by many as the
best film ever made.</p>

<p>In 2015, the brilliant writer Aaron Sorkin made a movie loosely
based on a famous, powerful, contemporary American business figure
&#8212; the technology innovator Steve Jobs &#8212; that showed him in a bad
light. He, too, took artistic liberties with the character, and
with events. But, his entertaining work of fiction isn&#8217;t labeled
for what it is. It&#8217;s called <em>Steve Jobs</em> and is based in part on
Walter Isaacson&#8217;s authorized biography of the man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I made the same comparison to <em>Citizen Kane</em> on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/10/17/ep-133">last week&#8217;s episode of The Talk Show</a>, with Serenity Caldwell. What I didn&#8217;t mention during the show is that calling this movie &#8220;Steve Jobs&#8221;, and using real names of real people to tell a largely fictional story, is purely cynical. They&#8217;re selling a lot more tickets to a movie about &#8220;Steve Jobs&#8221; and &#8220;Apple Computer&#8221; than they would if were about, say, a Jobs-like character named Dave Gibbs (or whatever) who was the headstrong founder of Orange Computer.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a term for this in fiction: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_à_clef">roman à clef</a>. Other examples I can think of, in cinema: Paul Thomas Anderson&#8217;s <em>The Master</em> (loosely based on L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology) and Martin Scorsese&#8217;s <em>GoodFellas</em> and <em>Casino</em> (both adapted from non-fiction books by Nicholas Pileggi).</p>

<p>I think Tim Cook was exactly right <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/25/9399233/aaron-sorkin-slams-apple-ceo-tim-cook">in calling this film &#8220;opportunistic&#8221;</a>. It wouldn&#8217;t sell without the &#8220;Steve Jobs&#8221; name, but it&#8217;s only loosely &#8212; very loosely &#8212; about the real Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>If you want to see a movie where Steve Wozniak is begging Steve Jobs to thank the Apple II engineering team on stage in 1998&#8217;s iMac introduction, and in which Jobs blames Woz for the Newton, go buy a ticket. (In the real world, Woz left Apple as a full-time employee in 1985, and the last Apple II models were discontinued in 1993.)</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Storage capacities and battery life are unchanged from last year&#8217;s iPhones. Everything else &#8212; the materials it&#8217;s made from, the performance of its custom CPU/GPU, the quality of the cameras, the smoothness of the user interface &#8212; is noticeably, tangibly improved.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The pattern is pretty clear. In even-numbered years (2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) Apple releases all-new iPhone form factors: 3G, 4, 5, 6/6 Plus. In the subsequent years, they release &#8220;S&#8221; variants: iPhones that look nearly identical to their predecessors, but with improved components.</p>

<p>Why do they do this?</p>

<p>There are some ecosystem advantages to this tick-tock<sup id="fnr1-2015-09-22"><a href="#fn1-2015-09-22">1</a></sup> schedule. Most iPhone cases, for example, fit both the tick and tock iPhones. (The rare exceptions are certain hard cases with extremely tight tolerances. The iPhones 6S, for example, are both a few tenths of a millimeter bigger, wider, and thicker than their corresponding siblings from last year.) I think there are some branding advantages to this two-year cycle as well. iPhones are iconic devices. The devices themselves are recognizable. Keeping each new form factor around for two model years lets that iconic appearance seep deeper into the mass market collective consciousness.</p>

<p>Releasing a new generation of iPhones every year &#8212; year in, year out &#8212; is an aggressive pace given the scale and scope of the iPhone, and its importance to Apple financially. Sure, other handset makers put out dozens of different models every year. But Apple is playing an entirely different game. With one exception &#8212; the iPhone 5C two years ago (a phone which, as time goes by, seems more and more curious strategically) &#8212; Apple has never made a new iPhone other than a new top-of-the-line industry-leading flagship. In  the same way that automobiles don&#8217;t change form factors every year, I don&#8217;t think it would be feasible for Apple to change the iPhone&#8217;s form factor every year. I think it takes more than a year for Apple&#8217;s design team to create a new iPhone design &#8212; at least to create a new design that is different because it is <em>better</em>, not merely different for the sake of being different.</p>

<p>The glaring downside to this tick-tock schedule is that we as a culture &#8212; and <em>particularly</em> the media, both on the tech/gadgetry side and the business side &#8212; are obsessed with &#8220;new&#8221;. And, well, the S-model iPhones don&#8217;t look new. This year there is a new rose gold aluminum finish, but at a glance, the iPhones 6S look like last year&#8217;s iPhones 6. Every year is an <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple_rolls.html">iterative improvement</a> over the previous one, whether it&#8217;s an S year or not. But it&#8217;s hard not to see the S years as <em>more</em> iterative, less impressive, updates, simply because they look the same.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s a trap &#8212; a way to be fooled by your eyes. If you put aside what the phones look like, the S model years have brought some of the biggest changes to the platform. The display changes came in non-S years, of course &#8212; the iPhone 4 going retina; the iPhone 5 expanding from 3.5 to 4 inches diagonally and changing the aspect ratio; and of course last year&#8217;s 6/6 Plus expanding to 4.7 and 5.5 inches and higher display resolutions. But it was the 3GS that first improved on CPU performance and gave us the first improvements to the camera. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/iphone_4s">The 4S</a> ushered in Siri integration and a much faster camera. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c">The 5S</a> was Apple&#8217;s first 64-bit ARM device, years ahead of the competition, and was the first device with Touch ID. For a typical iPhone user on a two-year upgrade cycle, I think the S years are the better phones, historically.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a passage from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c">my 5S/5C review</a> two years ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Refinement, in the eyes of these naysayers, does not count as
innovation. Only revolution counts. But the iPhone needs no
revolution. It continues to sell better year-over-year, year after
year, without lowering its prices. Every step of the way between
2007 and that lone original iPhone &#8212; running an OS with no
third-party apps, no multitasking, not even copy-and-paste &#8212; and
today’s world, where Apple is on the cusp of selling its 700
millionth iOS device and the lineup ranges from the iPod Touch to
the iPhones to two sizes of iPad, has been about just that:
<em>refinement</em>.</p>

<p>The iPhone 5S shows that there remains much room for refinement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s ever been more of a trap to approach an S-model iPhone as &#8220;just a slightly improved version of last year&#8217;s iPhone&#8221; than this year.</p>

<p>I used to think &#8212; and maybe it was even true &#8212; that one of the advantages to Apple of the tick-tock cycle is that during the S years, they&#8217;re already experts at manufacturing a bunch of the components. That they&#8217;ve already got a year of experience making that case, that display, those buttons. That manufacturing-wise, Apple could just swap in a few new components, like a new A-series CPU, and call it a day. But the iPhones 6S don&#8217;t use the same case as last year&#8217;s models. They&#8217;re now made out of an altogether new &#8220;7000 series&#8221; aluminum alloy. This isn&#8217;t just a new material that needs to be obtained in massive quantities, it also requires new CNC machining to carve and polish the frames. The displays are the same sizes as last year, but Apple is using a new glass that it calls &#8220;the strongest in the smartphone industry&#8221;.<sup id="fnr2-2015-09-22"><a href="#fn2-2015-09-22">2</a></sup> Even the Touch ID sensor is new. Everything you can <em>touch</em> on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus is new.</p>

<p>Internally, Apple has added force sensors to enable 3D Touch. They&#8217;ve replaced the chintzy old vibrating engine with a &#8220;Taptic&#8221; engine. Both LTE and Wi-Fi now support faster speeds (and LTE supports more bands, increasing compatibility with networks around the world). The camera now supports 4K video and shoots better (and bigger) still photos. On the iPhone 6S Plus, image stabilization now works with video in addition to stills. The CPU and GPU improvements in the A9 system-on-a-chip are more dramatic compared to the A8 than the A8 was to the A7.</p>

<p>Apple has even &#8212; dare I say <em>finally</em> &#8212; increased the amount of RAM, from 1 GB to 2.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBYWGjIzvyw">The Only Thing That&#8217;s Changed Is Everything</a>&#8221; is the slogan of Apple&#8217;s marketing campaign for the iPhones 6S. I can&#8217;t beat that. I&#8217;ve been testing both models for 12 days, and what Apple is saying about the new iPhones is true. They don&#8217;t <em>look</em> new, but almost everything about them <em>is</em> new.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s backwards to think that in an S year, Apple simply takes the previous model and makes a few tweaks. Instead, I think what&#8217;s obvious is that knowing the basic industrial design at least two years ahead of time gives the engineering teams inside Apple an opportunity to make significant changes to the components and the materials used to construct them. The timeline for iPhones, because of the massive scale at which they must be manufactured, is such that, right now, as I&#8217;m typing this, the design for next year&#8217;s iPhone 7 is either locked down or very close to it. The company will now spend the next year hustling to make it work and put it into production so it can start shipping a year from now. But that means there are also teams already at work on the iPhone 7S slated for 2017 &#8212; and they have a massive head start in terms of knowing the shape and dimensions of the device.</p>

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>As usual, I&#8217;ll leave in-depth performance analysis to others, but I did run <a href="http://www.primatelabs.com/geekbench/">the Geekbench 3</a> general-purpose benchmark. All devices were running the release version of iOS 9.0. I ran the benchmark three times after restarting the device, and put all devices in airplane mode during the tests. I&#8217;ve rounded the scores to the nearest tens digit. For both the iPhone 6 and 6S, the scores for the 5.5-inch Plus models were effectively identical to the 4.7-inch models, so they aren’t broken out separately.</p>

</table></p>

<p>Two observations here. First, there is a noticeably bigger performance increase across the board going from the 6 to the 6S than there was last year, going from the 5S to the 6. In broad strokes, the non-S iPhones are about physical style, the S models are about performance. (At the introduction of the 3GS in 2009, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=5cvTRjPnV8c#t=139">Phil Schiller claimed the &#8220;S&#8221; stood for &#8220;speed&#8221;</a>. Since then, Apple hasn&#8217;t said what any of the S&#8217;s stand for, but &#8220;speed&#8221; still fits)</p>

<p>Second, take a look at Geekbench&#8217;s aggregate results <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/android-benchmarks">for Android</a> devices. (<a href="/misc/2015/09/android-geekbench-results-sept-2015.png">Here&#8217;s a screenshot</a> as it stands today, for posterity.) In terms of single-core performance, there isn&#8217;t a single Android phone that beats the two-year-old iPhone 5S. Android devices fare better in multi-core benchmarks, because they have more cores (some have eight, many have four &#8212; the iPhones 6S still have only two cores), but single-core performance is a better measure for the sort of things you can <em>feel</em> while using a device. Apple is literally years ahead of the industry. Even if you don&#8217;t agree that single-core performance is the more meaningful benchmark, you can&#8217;t deny that iPhone benchmarks don&#8217;t look <em>anything</em> like the benchmarks for high-end Android devices. With the Mac, Apple uses the same Intel chips as its PC competition. On mobile, though, Apple&#8217;s in-house chip team has given the company a tremendous advantage over the rest of the industry.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Mac and performance, again looking at single-core performance, <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks">Geekbench results</a> put the iPhone 6S at roughly the same score as a 2012 or 2013 MacBook Air. Even more intriguing is a comparison to the new single-port MacBook:</p>

<p><table width=500>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="left">Test</th>
  <th align="right">iPhone 6S</th>
  <th align="right">MacBook<br/>(1.3 GHz)</th>
  <th align="right">MacBook<br/>(1.2 GHz)</th>
  <th align="right">MacBook<br/>(1.1 GHz)</th>
</tr>

<tbody></p>

<p><tr>
  <td align="left">Single Core</td>
  <td align="right">2500</td>
  <td align="right">2631</td>
  <td align="right">2420</td>
  <td align="right">2295</td>
</tr></p>

<p><tr>
  <td align="left">Multi-Core</td>

  <td align="right">5268</td>
  <td align="right">5018</td>
  <td align="right">4464</td>
</tr></p>

<p></tbody>
</table></p>

<p><em>The new iPhone 6S beats the new MacBook in single-core performance on Geekbench</em>, and is within spitting distance in multi-core. That&#8217;s astounding. I can&#8217;t wait to see the scores for the iPad Pro later this year.</p>

<h2>3D Touch</h2>

<p>3D Touch can be used in a few ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Quick Actions: The pop-up menu you see from the home screen when you press on an app icon.</p></li>
<li><p>Peek and Pop: Press a little to get a peek, press harder to pop whatever you&#8217;re peeking at open. This works mostly on list items. So in Mail, from your list of messages, you can peek to look at a message, then pop to open it all the way up. It works almost everywhere in Apple&#8217;s own apps: Messages, Camera, Maps, Weather, Safari (page previews on links), Notes, Calendar, and more. It pays to explore.</p></li>
<li><p>Multitasking: As an alternative to double-pressing the home button, you can now press on the left edge of the display. Press-and-swipe all the way across and you switch back to the previous app you were using. Press-and-swipe just a little and you&#8217;re left in the &#8220;card view&#8221; where you can switch to any previous application. The former is like hitting Command-Tab just once. The latter is like hitting Tab repeatedly while holding down the Command key. This is quickly addictive, and a great accommodation now that the iPhones are bigger than they used to be &#8212; you can switch between apps without changing your grip to allow your thumb to reach the Home button.</p></li>
<li><p>Trackpad Mode: Press on the keyboard and it turns into a trackpad. iPads running iOS 9 can trigger this trackpad mode, too, with a two-finger swipe on the keyboard. Doing it with a single finger on the iPhone, though, is a tremendous boon to text editing. This might be the single best new feature for text editing on the iPhone since the addition of selection and Copy/Paste in iOS 3 in 2009. In addition to moving the insertion point around, you can press again and switch to selection mode &#8212; like double-clicking the mouse button on a Mac. Trackpad mode is a once-you&#8217;ve-used-it-you-can&#8217;t-go-back addition to iOS.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are other uses for 3D Touch as well. When drawing in the new Notes app or using Markup to annotate an image in Mail, you can press harder to draw thicker strokes. (The same also applies when drawing Chinese characters on Chinese handwriting keyboards.) If you press on one of the new &#8220;dynamic wallpapers&#8221; on the lock screen, it animates for a few seconds, like a Live Photo. (Or you can set your lock screen wallpaper to a Live Photo you&#8217;ve taken yourself. But Apple&#8217;s &#8220;dynamic wallpapers&#8221; have a higher frame rate than the live photos you can take yourself; they&#8217;re obviously <em>like</em> live photos, but they&#8217;re not the same thing as the ones you can take with the iPhone 6S camera.)</p>

<p>The wallpaper animation is gimmicky, but fun. Most of the other uses for 3D Touch, though, are legitimate productivity gains. I find myself using the shortcuts on the icons for Messages (to jump to one of your three most-active recent threads) and Camera (to choose which mode to start in: front-facing self-portrait, video, slo-mo, or still) frequently. It&#8217;s habit-forming.</p>

<p>Peek-and-pop for, say, reading email &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t too sure about that at first. But watching <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/16/cook-colbert">Tim Cook&#8217;s appearance on Stephen Colbert</a>, I took note when Cook claimed it helps him get through his inbox faster. I tried it again, and noticed for the first time that while peeking, you can slide the message left or right to trash or archive it. It really is an efficient way to triage messages, especially ones that you can&#8217;t get the gist of from the two- or three-line preview in the message list itself. And, you can drag a message <em>up</em> to get an activity sheet with additional actions, like Reply, Forward, Notify Me, and more. The productivity gain with this workflow is that you don&#8217;t have to go &#8220;back&#8221; after finishing. Peek, swipe to the side to archive, and it&#8217;s gone. Anywhere you can peek, try sliding the peek around.</p>

<p>I have only two bad things to say about 3D Touch. First, Apple missed an opportunity to borrow a great feature from Apple Watch. On Apple Watch, you can force touch in the notification list and you get an option to Clear All. 3D Touch has no effect in iOS 9&#8217;s notification list, and there remains no way to clear all notifications at once.</p>

<p>Second, I find myself triggering the Quick Action menu inadvertently when I want to enter &#8220;jiggle mode&#8221; on the home screen, to either delete or move an app. Tap-and-wait long-pressing has always been a little frustrating to me. I don&#8217;t like to wait. I&#8217;m impatient. So when I go to move an app on the iPhone 6S, I press on it, and more often than not, I press hard enough to register as a 3D Touch. For apps that don&#8217;t have any Quick Actions (which is to say, as of this writing, all third-party apps), what happens next is that you get a wee bit of haptic feedback to let you know your press registered as a 3D Touch event, but that there are no Quick Actions for this app. It feels like two very quick gentle taps. This haptic feedback is very clever. There is no alert, and no sound. Just that little feedback that feels like the haptic equivalent of your phone telling you &#8220;<em>Uh-uh</em>&#8221;. But the experience is frustrating, because now it&#8217;s taking me even longer to enter jiggle mode: first, without thinking about what I&#8217;m doing, I accidentally trigger the &#8220;<em>Uh-uh</em>, no quick actions for this app&#8221; 3D Touch. Then I have to let go, purposefully tap-and-hold gently, and wait. I expect to get used to this over time, but at this point, 3D Touch and long-pressing feel like they&#8217;re at odds with each other.</p>

<p>Overall, it seems very clear to me that 3D Touch will spread across the entire iOS device line. Like Touch ID and retina displays, it&#8217;s simply debuting on the iPhone first.</p>

<h2>Taptic Engine</h2>

<p>Speaking of the new Taptic Engine, it&#8217;s excellent. It doesn&#8217;t just provide for 3D Touch feedback, but it also serves as the vibrator for notifications. It is stronger, more noticeable, and in my opinion more pleasing than any previous iPhone vibrator. Back in 2011, Apple switched to a superior oscillating vibrator in the iPhone 4S (and the Verizon/CDMA iPhone 4). All previous iPhones used a cheaper rotational vibrator. The oscillating vibrator in the iPhone 4S was noticeably nicer. For whatever reason, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/09/28/yes-iphone-5-vibrate-differently/">Apple went back to a rotational vibrator in the iPhone 5</a>, and stuck with it through the iPhone 6. The new taptic engine in the 6S feels as good or better than the old iPhone 4S vibrator. It&#8217;s just stronger and more pleasing.</p>

<p>The 3D Touch feedback is well-designed. Peeks feel gentle, pops feel stronger &#8212; sort of like a half tap and a full tap. When you press something in the interface that has only one level of 3D Touch (like the Quick Action menu on a home screen icon), you get the full-strength tap feedback, which is a way of letting you know, by feel, that there&#8217;s no reason to press harder. If you feel a peek, you know you can press hard to pop; if you feel a pop, you know you&#8217;re done. Once you get used to it, peek/pop is as intuitive as the shutter button on a camera, where you can press halfway to engage autofocus and set the exposure, and press the rest of the way to take a picture.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>

<p>Speaking of which, the iPhone 6S cameras are terrific. They&#8217;re fast, responsive, and accurate &#8212; <em>accurate</em> meaning that unedited, right off the camera roll, the color and light reproduction look like how the scene appeared to my eyes. More than any other aspect of the iPhone, the camera exemplifies the advantages of Apple&#8217;s integration of hardware and software.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still not sure what to make of the Live Photos feature. Is it a gimmick? I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;m still shooting with the feature turned on. Technically, the way it seems to work is that the iPhone creates two files: a 12 MP JPEG (exactly the same as when you shoot a still image with Live Photo disabled), and a three-second-long MOV file. When looked at through Image Capture on a Mac running OS X 10.10.x, you see both files in the iPhone camera roll: &#8220;IMG_1234.JPG&#8221; and &#8220;IMG_1234.MOV&#8221;. Both files have same numeric index after the &#8220;IMG_&#8221; prefix, and both files have the same creation date. The MOV file is 1440 × 1080 pixels, at 12.77 frames-per-second.</p>

<p>Technically, of course, a MOV file is a video. But I think one of the reasons Apple is adamantly refusing to describe Live Photos as &#8220;video&#8221; is that these animated sidecars aren&#8217;t high-quality videos in and of themselves. That they are video files, under the hood, is just an implementation detail.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also worth emphasizing that these Live Photos are <em>not</em> implemented by burst mode. You can still engage burst mode by holding down the shutter button, but you still only get about six or seven frames per second. When taking a burst of stills, Live Photo is disabled &#8212; you just get a regular series of still images, grouped together in the camera roll just like on the iPhone 6.</p>

<p>So the way Live Photo works, I think, is this: when you&#8217;re in still photo mode with Live Photo turned on, the iPhone is constantly capturing 1440 × 1080 video at 12.77 FPS, but keeping only the most recent 1.5 seconds. Then when you tap the shutter to capture a still, it takes a 12-megapixel still image <em>in between capturing frames of the video</em>. Then the camera continues capturing another 1.5 seconds of video. So you wind up with 1.5 seconds of video prior to hitting the shutter, one still image at the maximum resolution of the image sensor, and another 1.5 seconds of video from after the shutter press. Because there is only one 12-megapixel still image captured, you can&#8217;t change the &#8220;key frame&#8221; of a Live Photo.</p>

<p>In iOS 9.0, the timing of this video capture is hard-coded. You get 3 seconds of video &#8212; 1.5 seconds on each side of the still capture &#8212; every time. This means, however, if you snap your photo and then lower the camera, you wind up with a &#8220;droop&#8221; at the end of your live photo animation &#8212; usually a blurry view of the floor. Apple has already addressed this in the betas for iOS 9.1. In 9.1, the camera will use the accelerometer to detect when you lower the camera after snapping a shot, and truncate the animation at that point. So in 9.0, all live photos are 3 seconds long, but many will have an unfortunate droop at the end. Starting in 9.1, live photos will be up to 3 seconds long, with no droops.</p>

<p><a href="/misc/2015/09/live-photo-edit-warning.jpg">You cannot edit Live Photos</a>. Well, you can edit them, but doing so turns them into stills.</p>

<p>One other camera feature demands mention, and it breaks my heart. Last year, the iPhone 6 Plus, and only the Plus, included optical image stabilization. This year, OIS remains a Plus-only feature, and Apple has made it even better, because it now works with video. The advantages of OIS for video are even greater than for still images, in my opinion. You know how when you watch a video someone shot on their phone &#8212; any phone &#8212; and when they walk around, you can see the picture rock up and down with each step they take? It&#8217;s a signature of amateur video shot on consumer cameras, and it&#8217;s unpleasant to say the least.</p>

<p>OIS for video reduces this jerkiness. And in my testing on the iPhone 6S Plus, the effect is dramatic. It&#8217;s a poor man&#8217;s Steadicam, built right into the iPhone 6S Plus. I say that this breaks my heart because, personally, I have no interest in owning the 6S Plus &#8212; I much prefer the pocketability and feel-in-hand of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6S. I could tell myself last year that the 6 Plus&#8217;s camera was only a wee bit better than the regular 6&#8217;s, and only under certain conditions. This year, OIS for video means the iPhone 6S Plus is capable of something the regular 6S is not: shooting smooth full-size videos while you walk around or pan the camera.<sup id="fnr3-2015-09-22"><a href="#fn3-2015-09-22">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Lastly, I can&#8217;t write about the camera without complaining that the bump for the lens is still there. I understand the physics and optics involved, but it bothers me every single day that I can feel that nubbin. The best argument for forgiving the camera bump is that a vast majority of iPhone owners use a case of some sort, and with a case, the camera bump is a non-issue. But for those of us who don&#8217;t use cases, and who appreciate Apple&#8217;s general attention to every little detail, it&#8217;s a very minor but daily irritation. My number one hope for next year is that Apple can continue to improve image quality while somehow getting rid of the bump.</p>

<h2>Miscellany</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>One thing that hasn&#8217;t changed from last year&#8217;s iPhone 6 models: storage tiers of 16, 64, and 128 GB. The units I received for testing (one 6S, one 6S Plus) were both 128 GB. I&#8217;m sure most people can get by easily with the 64 GB models. For anyone who is not completely certain that they don&#8217;t need much storage, I would recommend against the 16 GB models. <a href="https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/09/10/16gb-is-a-bad-user-experience/">It&#8217;s too easy to fill them up</a>. I wish Apple had switched the baseline from 16 to 32 GB. 4K video is off by default (the default is 1080p at 30 FPS), but forget about shooting 4K with a 16 GB device. <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/10/iphone-6s-4k-video-size/">Apple says 4K video takes up 375 MB per minute</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing that nags me whenever I complain about these 16 GB phones. My gut feeling is that they&#8217;re too small. <a href="https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/09/10/16gb-is-a-bad-user-experience/">Data from third-party app analytics</a> suggests they&#8217;re too small for many of the people who buy them. But Apple has more data on iPhone usage than anyone, and the company is obsessed with customer satisfaction. They measure customer satisfaction through surveys as accurately and scientifically as they can. How often does Tim Cook speak in public without the words &#8220;customer sat&#8221; coming out of his mouth? If last year&#8217;s 16 GB baseline adversely affected customer satisfaction, you&#8217;d think Apple would have done something about it this year, right? The only other explanation that makes sense is that it <em>does</em> adversely affect customer satisfaction, but they&#8217;re willing to take the hit in the name of higher average selling prices, because of the people who wind up buying 64 GB models who would have bought a 32 GB model for $100 less if that had been an option. Again, to me, 16/64/128 is not good/better/best &#8212; it&#8217;s OK/better/best.</p></li>
<li><p>Also seemingly unchanged from last year: the effective battery life of the device. I didn&#8217;t perform any sort of battery life tests, but in heavy daily usage, the iPhone 6S felt like it got the same battery life as the iPhone 6 I&#8217;ve been using for a year. No better, no worse. Like last year, the iPhone 6S Plus clearly gets way better battery life than the regular 6S, simply because it has room for a far larger battery.</p></li>
<li><p>The 6S models are heavier than last year&#8217;s phones: the 6S is 14 grams heavier than the 6 (143/129g); the 6S Plus is 20 grams heavier than the 6 Plus (192/172g). Some of this might be due to the new Taptic Engine (which looks bigger in Apple&#8217;s see-the-components promotional video) and the sensors for 3D Touch, but I presume most of the difference is due to the switch to higher-grade 7000-series aluminum. Well worth it for the additional structural integrity &#8212; I don&#8217;t expect any complaints about bending this year. [<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/12/9315471/iphone-6s-new-aluminum-doesnt-make-phone-heavier">According to The Verge</a>, most of the weight gain is from the touch sensors in the new display assembly, not the aluminum.]</p>

<p>This is subjective, but it seems to me that the new iPhones <em>feel</em> different to the touch. It&#8217;s not dramatic, but I think they&#8217;re less slippery. I&#8217;ve gone case-less with every iPhone I&#8217;ve owned, and the only one I&#8217;ve ever dropped and had the screen crack was the iPhone 6. The larger size and rounded edges made the iPhone 6 less grip-able than my beloved old iPhone 5S. It could just be the extra weight, but in blind testing, I can feel the difference between my old iPhone 6 and the new 6S. It&#8217;s just a wee bit more tacky, and it&#8217;s either due to the material, or the wear and tear of a year&#8217;s usage on my iPhone 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple is billing the new Touch ID sensor as &#8220;up to 2× faster&#8221;. They&#8217;re underselling it. It&#8217;s so fast now that every single time I press it, it unlocks the phone, no matter how brief the contact is between my finger and the sensor. I can sit here and try to use the home button to get to the lock screen, and I can&#8217;t unless I purposefully only touch a small portion of the button or use an unregistered finger. It&#8217;s that fast. This actually takes some getting used it, if, like me, you sometimes use the home button just to get to the lock screen to check the date or time. With the new Touch ID sensor, the home button <em>instantly</em> unlocks the phone and I need to use the sleep/wake button to get to the lock screen.</p></li>
<li><p>You know those FCC-mandated regulatory logos etched on the back of your iPhone? <a href="https://twitter.com/varunorcv/status/644937141340889088">They&#8217;re gone</a>. Last year <a href="http://www.metlabs.com/blog/emc/fcc-issues-guidance-on-new-e-labeling/">the FCC issued new guidelines</a> that allow manufacturers to put all these labels in software, for display on screen, and Apple has done just that. (You can see them in <em>Settings: General: Regulatory</em>.) It&#8217;s such a little thing, but those little turds have always bothered me. Curiously, one previous iPhone also lacked these regulatory etchings: the Verizon iPhone 4. I have no idea why that one iPhone was able to omit them but subsequent ones were not.</p>

<p>Replacing the regulatory turds is a simple &#8220;S&#8221; under the &#8220;iPhone&#8221; on the back of the phone. Previous S-model iPhones were not labeled as such.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#8217;t plan to use one, but Apple&#8217;s new cases are very nice. Both the silicone and leather cases come in nicer colors than last year &#8212; and they complement/match Apple&#8217;s lineup of Sport and leather straps for Apple Watch nicely. They really seem to have upped their game with leatherwork. Just for kicks I spent a few days of my review period with the iPhone 6S in the saddle brown case, and I really liked the way it looked and felt. It seems like the sort of leather that will look better as it ages. The biggest thing keeping me from using this case for real, going forward, is that the raised edge along the side of the display gets in the way of performing edge-based gestures, primarily swiping to go back, and the new press-and-swipe to switch between apps with 3D Touch.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>New-number iPhones (4, 5, 6) are about showing off Apple&#8217;s design prowess. The S models are about showing off Apple&#8217;s engineering prowess. Storage capacities and battery life are unchanged from last year&#8217;s iPhones. Everything else &#8212; the materials they&#8217;re made from, the performance of their custom CPU/GPU, the quality of the cameras, the smoothness of the user interface &#8212; is noticeably, tangibly improved.</p>

<p>There might be other examples, but in tech the most well-known example of this strategy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Tick-Tock">Intel&#8217;s CPU schedule</a>: one generation is a new microarchitecture (big new change) and the next is a shrinking of the previous one. What isn&#8217;t obvious is that the &#8220;tocks&#8221; are the new microarchitectures, and the &#8220;ticks&#8221; are the die shrinkings. So for iPhones, the S models are the ticks, and the new form factors are the tocks. That seems counter-intuitive, of course, because we say &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; but the tocks come before the ticks. That&#8217;s kind of stupid if you ask me, so if you want to call the new form factor models the ticks and the S models the tocks, go right ahead.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2015-09-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>What does &#8220;stronger&#8221; mean? More scratch-resistant? Less prone to cracking when dropped? Both?

<p>There are a few apps for the iPhone that implement image-stabilization for video in software.

Both apps work well, but there&#8217;s no way to cheat true optical image stabilization. These apps smooth out the motion in video by cropping the frames. So you lose some resolution and wind up with a narrow field of view. The bigger downside is that you have remember to use these apps before you start shooting. When I see something I want to capture, I&#8217;m already in the system Camera app before I think about it.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr3-2015-09-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>iOS 9&#8217;s keyboard has a big change: the alphabetic key caps change case &#8212; they&#8217;re lowercase when typing lowercase, uppercase when Shift or Caps Lock is engaged. Android and Windows Phone keyboards have always done this.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like it, and I&#8217;m <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffChausse/status/644716910425317376">not</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/craigmod/status/644767211505106944">alone</a>.</p>

<p>The good news: You can turn this off and go back to the way the keyboard was meant to be, with all caps alphabetic keys all the time. The confusing part: For some  reason, the setting for this is not in <em>Settings: General: Keyboard</em>. Instead, it&#8217;s in <em>Settings: General: Accessibility: Keyboard</em>.</p>

<p>Some people love this feature, so it&#8217;s great that it&#8217;s a setting. I dislike it because having the keys change automatically while I&#8217;m looking at the keyboard makes it look like it&#8217;s vibrating or flickering. I spent a week with the case-shifting enabled this summer (using the iOS 9 betas) and it drove me nuts. To me it&#8217;s distracting and looks a little cheap, and if it were up to me, it wouldn&#8217;t be the default.</p>

<p>The main argument I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/10/8756243/ios-9-keyboard-lowercase-shift">in favor</a> of this change holds no water: that this is the solution to iOS 7&#8217;s is-it-on-or-is-it-off? <a href="http://www.allenpike.com/2014/schrodingers-shift-key/">Schrödinger&#8217;s Shift Key</a>. The proper solution to an ambiguous Shift key is to replace it with an unambiguous Shift key. The lack of case shifting on the keyboard was not a problem on iOS 1-6 because <a href="https://darrenalawi.com/blog/fixing-the-ios-shift-key/">the Shift key on the old keyboard was unambiguous</a>. Whether you prefer a case-shifting keyboard or not, the Shift key should be unambiguous. These are two different things.</p>

<p>The good news is, Apple <em>did</em> improve the Shift key on iOS 9. When not engaged, the arrow glyph on the key cap is now hollow. When Shift is engaged, the key turns white and the arrow is solid black. With Caps Lock on, the arrow gets an underscore. </p>

<hr />

<p>One more iOS 9 change to the iPhone keyboard: there is now an option not to show the popup character preview as you type (<em>Settings: General: Keyboard: Character Preview</em>). The iPad keyboard has never shown these previews, presumably because the keys are big enough that you can see the keys themselves highlight as you tap them. Prior to iOS 9, however, the iPhone keyboard has <em>always</em> shown them.</p>

<p>While running beta versions of iOS 9 over the summer, I tried turning off character previews, but soon turned them back on. I&#8217;m just too accustomed to them after eight years of daily iPhone use. With previews off, it feels to me like the keyboard isn&#8217;t working.</p>

<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> At one point during the summer, the iOS 9 betas were <em>defaulting</em> to <em>not</em> show character previews, and I incorrectly assumed this was still the case when I first published this piece. In the release version of iOS 9.0, characters previews remain on by default, and I&#8217;ve rewritten the above accordingly. Sorry for any confusion.]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/28842/Apple_s_veto_power_over_new_web_technologies_">Thom Holwerda posted a link on OSNews</a> to my comments <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/15/ppk-stop-pushing-web-forward">about Apple effectively having veto power</a> over new web technologies. He didn&#8217;t add much commentary, other than:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What could possibly go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6">wrong</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ll save you a link hover &#8212; &#8220;wrong&#8221; links to Wikipedia&#8217;s entry on IE 6.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.osnews.com/comments/28842">The comments</a> on Holwerda&#8217;s piece are interesting, insofar as they convey the frustration of those who resent Apple&#8217;s position.</p>

<p>It has nagged me ever since the &#8220;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=safari%20is%20the%20new%20ie">Safari Is the New IE</a>&#8221; debate erupted a few months ago that there&#8217;s a simple, succinct, counterargument. I just couldn&#8217;t put my finger on it. Reading Holwerda&#8217;s post yesterday, it popped into my head. The difference is that IE 6, at its peak, wasn&#8217;t just so popular that it allowed Microsoft to unduly influence the direction of the web &#8212; <em>IE 6 was so popular that it allowed Microsoft to define the web</em>. It was as though IE 6 <em>was</em> the web. When banking sites required ActiveX plugins, they were making websites that <em>only</em> worked in Internet Explorer, <em>only</em> on Windows. In the eyes of many web developers and publishers, it was the one and only browser that mattered.</p>

<p>The web today is nothing like that. No single browser (or rendering engine) has an overwhelmingly dominant position. Four browsers/rendering engines share the world: Microsoft&#8217;s IE/Trident (and now the modernized Windows 10 browser, Edge), Mozilla&#8217;s Gecko, Apple&#8217;s Safari/WebKit, and Google&#8217;s Chrome/Blink. In a world where one rendering engine does not rule the entire web, conflicts between the various popular engines are inevitable.</p>

<p>There are a lot of nerds &#8212; and I use that term affectionately, not pejoratively &#8212; for whom politics of any sort are just anathema. Government, office, standards body &#8212; any sort of politics. Politics are often illogical, and often unfair. Nerds crave logic and fairness. Because of this willful political blindness, my main point regarding Apple&#8217;s veto power over web browser technologies is missed by some. It isn&#8217;t whether it is right or wrong, fair or unfair, that they have this power. Nor is it whether Apple&#8217;s strategy is the correct one. It&#8217;s simply to point out that they <em>have</em> this veto power. And so do Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla &#8212; Apple isn&#8217;t any more powerful than the others. (Except Mozilla, which I&#8217;d argue is the least powerful of the big four rendering engine makers &#8212; see below.) What makes Apple and Safari stand out isn&#8217;t that they have <em>more</em> influence. It&#8217;s that Apple&#8217;s interests have diverged from those of a certain segment of the web development community &#8212; <a href="http://nolanlawson.com/2015/06/30/safari-is-the-new-ie/">the segment interested in making mobile web apps more like native apps</a>.</p>

<p>WebKit&#8217;s contrary priorities are not the result of <a href="https://kenneth.io/blog/2015/07/03/safari-isnt-the-problem-but-the-lack-of-browser-choice-in-ios-is/">disinterest in the web</a>; they are the result of differing interest in the web.</p>

<p>As for how Apple can simply do what it wants, consider the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia. They each have veto power over any resolution. Critics complain that this veto power is undemocratic. Of course it is! These are the countries that won World War II and are officially recognized as nuclear-weapon states. Democratically, it isn&#8217;t fair that each member gets veto power. But a nuclear weapon arsenal gives each country geopolitical influence that cannot be denied or ignored. Might makes right. Whether that is how it ought to be doesn&#8217;t matter. That&#8217;s how it is.</p>

<p>There is no official &#8220;Web Standards Security Council&#8221;, but web browsing market share creates a de facto one. Apple (or Google, or Microsoft, or Mozilla) can&#8217;t single-handedly veto a new API from becoming an official W3C standard, but if any one of them decides not to implement it, it can&#8217;t be relied upon by web developers. The real web is not that which is defined by the W3C as a standard,<sup id="fnr1-2015-09-18"><a href="#fn1-2015-09-18">1</a></sup> but that which is implemented in a consistent manner across WebKit, Blink, Trident, and Gecko. The secret to the web&#8217;s wonderful success is that it&#8217;s a (nearly) universal meta-platform; that which is not implemented on a major platform, like, say, iOS, is by definition not universal.</p>

<p>The web community cannot compel any of these browser engine makers to implement a standard. Nothing the community does will make Apple, Microsoft, or Google act against their own self interests. Mozilla is a little different &#8212; they are <em>of</em> the web community. They control no popular device platform on which Mozilla is the factory-installed default browser. But in that same way, the other companies <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/mozilla-execs-capitulate-in-h-264-web-video-war/">could not force Mozilla to accept the patent-encumbered H.264 standard for HTML 5 video</a>. Mozilla stood its ground, on principle &#8212; effectively exercising its own de facto veto power. Years later they changed their mind in the face of overwhelming demand and the failure of WebM to catch on. (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/14/mozilla-h264">They should have seen supporting H.264 as inevitable as far back as 2010</a>, but it was their prerogative to remain blinded by political high-mindedness in the name of &#8220;openness&#8221;.) The same will happen with any web technologies that Apple is slow to adopt. If such standards become popular in Chrome, IE, and Mozilla &#8212; popular in such a way that it becomes obvious that iOS users are missing on something everyone else is enjoying &#8212; Apple will be forced to relent, because it will be obvious that it&#8217;s in their own self-interest to do so. And if these web technologies don&#8217;t catch on, and pressure from real-world widespread usage doesn&#8217;t weigh upon Apple, there&#8217;s nothing the web developer community can do about it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s good or bad. It just is how it is.</p>

<h2>All for One, One for All</h2>

<p>This was it: one big event for <em>all</em> of Apple&#8217;s late 2015 product announcements. In the previous three years, Apple held separate events in September (iPhone) and October (iPad/Mac). They&#8217;ve done this because they typically have more to announce than would fit comfortably in one event. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/09/prelude_to_hey_siri_event">As I wrote yesterday</a>, I thought they&#8217;d have two events again this year, because it looked like they once again had more stuff ready to announce than would fit, comfortably, in one event.</p>

<p>To do just one event, something had to give. One casualty was the Mac. Other than a few offhand references to things that work with features in Mac OS X, <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/641689852023472128">the Mac got no stagetime whatsover</a>. El Capitan&#8217;s only public demo will have been at WWDC back in June. Whatever new Macs get released this year (retina 21-inch iMac, updated MacBook Pros?) will be announced via press releases.</p>

<p>The second casualty was my bladder. Today&#8217;s event ran 2h:20m, including the musical performance by One Republic. That&#8217;s long. Not ridiculously long. Not <em>too</em> long, even. But long. It couldn&#8217;t have gone any longer &#8212; and from what I&#8217;ve gathered from a few little birdies, Apple had to cut <em>a lot</em> during rehearsals to get it down to the length it ran.</p>

<p>My guess is that one event, in early September, is going to be the new normal. I gather that Apple has decided that putting all of its wood behind one fall event arrow, even if it means that they have to cut worthy products from getting any stage time, is better than spreading themselves too thin with two events in short succession.</p>

<h2>Staging</h2>

<p>Everything visible inside the Bill Graham Center was installed by Apple. Most of the structure was built just for the event. They even bought all the seating &#8212; you should probably contact Apple if you&#8217;re looking to buy theater seating. Effectively, Apple designed and built their own custom theater just for this event. It looked great. Especially the screen &#8212; that was the biggest and best screen I can recall at an Apple event. The acoustics and sound quality were excellent as well.</p>

<p>There were around 1,500 people in the audience &#8212; but at least 1,000 were Apple employees. That&#8217;s new &#8212; there have never been that many Apple employees at one of these events before, with the possible exception of last year&#8217;s event at the Flint Center. At a smaller venue like Yerba Buena or Apple&#8217;s tiny on-campus Town Hall, there just isn&#8217;t enough room. At WWDC (and in years past, Macworld Expo) Moscone is filled with paid ticket holders. Having that many employees in the room changes the tenor of the audience considerably &#8212; the cheering and applause were raucous.</p>

<p>In terms of stagecraft, this event was <em>really</em> well-structured and edited. That&#8217;s in stark contrast to June&#8217;s WWDC keynote, which was, by Apple&#8217;s standards, a bit of a rambling mess. In hindsight, I think this year&#8217;s WWDC keynote was the worst Apple event in years, and perhaps the worst in the modern (post-NeXT reunification) Apple era. It was too long, had no flow between acts/segments, and the Apple Music segment was downright awkward and under-rehearsed.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I didn&#8217;t expect to see iPad Pro announced at this event is that I thought adding a fourth act (in addition to iPhone, Watch, and TV) would make the show feel messy, like that WWDC keynote. Apple did add a fourth act, but there was a tight flow and it felt like there was a logical order to the segments. It felt like a show that had four acts, not just four announcements stitched together.</p>

<p>I have never been in the &#8220;<em>Apple is doomed without Steve Jobs</em>&#8221; camp, but I did long wonder whether Apple would suffer gravely without Jobs when it came to these keynotes. Not that Jobs, the presenter, was irreplaceable &#8212; even though, without question, he was the best stage presence, a genuine rock star. Apple has plenty of good presenters. It was Jobs the director, writer, and editor who I worried Apple would miss. The keynote auteur. Steve Jobs could look at a list of products and announcements and he knew how to structure an event around them. During rehearsals, Jobs had final cut over everything: what was announced, in what order, at what pace &#8212; every word, every slide. He had a knack for it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s often painfully obvious that the public presentations of big companies are dictated by internal politics more than showmanship. Jobs had the unquestioned stature to settle any such arguments, and his innate showmanship allowed him to keep the focus relentlessly on putting together a good cohesive <em>show</em>. I think we saw a drift away from that cohesiveness back at WWDC this year.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s event was a welcome course correction &#8212; and given the breadth of the announcements, it was all the more impressive.</p>

<h2>Apple Watch</h2>

<p>The expansion of color options for Apple&#8217;s sport bands was <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2015/04/17/custom-apple-watch-sport-bands/">predictable</a>, but it&#8217;s smart. With the addition of two new anodized colors for the Sport watches (gold and a feminine-but-not-girly rose gold), the complete product matrix for all the various watch straps, watch sizes, and watch finishes is remarkably complex. I think it&#8217;s a good example, though, of a product matrix that is <em>complex</em> but not <em>complicated</em>. People know what they like when they see it.</p>

<p>The Apple Watch Hermès is interesting. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/05/05/apple-watch-bands">I speculated back in May</a> that luxury brands like Tiffany and Louis Vuitton might make watch bands for Apple Watch. This is even better &#8212; a full-on partnership between Apple and a luxury fashion brand, including a custom branded watch face. (How will that work? A custom Hermès build of WatchOS &#8212; sort of like the individual per-carrier builds of iOS for iPhones? Or will WatchOS only offer the Hermès watch face on watches within a specific serial number / device ID range?) The Hermès straps are gorgeous.</p>

<p>I still think Tiffany is a good bet for a similar partnership. They have a signature color that would look great on a woman&#8217;s watch strap. Gucci would be a great fit, too. And of course Burberry, for <a href="https://www.apple.com/pr/bios/angela-ahrendts.html">obvious reasons</a>. In theory, Louis Vuitton would work, but in practice it might prove politically unfeasible, because Louis Vuitton is the &#8220;LV&#8221; in LVMH, the French luxury mega-conglomerate<sup id="fnr1-2015-09-09"><a href="#fn1-2015-09-09">1</a></sup> <a href="http://www.lvmh.com/houses/watches-jewelry/">that owns luxury watch brands</a> like TAG Heuer, Hublot, Zenith, and others.</p>

<h2>iPad Pro</h2>

<p>Apple called the A9X &#8220;desktop class&#8221;, and that&#8217;s not hyperbole. They said it outperforms 80 percent of laptops sold in the last 12 months &#8212; and 90 percent of them in graphics. But, let&#8217;s face it, the vast majority of &#8220;laptops&#8221; are piece of crap PCs. What&#8217;s impressive is that the iPad Pro will compare favorably to very recent MacBooks. I think it&#8217;ll benchmark comparably to, say, a 2013 MacBook Air. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the iPad Pro outperforms the Intel Core-based Surface Pro 3 from Microsoft. iPad Pro might be the inflection point where Apple&#8217;s ARM chips surpass Intel&#8217;s x86 in terms of raw speed for this class of hardware &#8212; and if it doesn&#8217;t, next year&#8217;s A10X will.</p>

<p>As with other iPads and iPhones, Apple won&#8217;t talk about RAM, even though developers will be able to find out as soon as they get their hands on them. If we were to wager on the amount of RAM in iPad Pro, my bet would be 4 GB. And I would wager very heavily.</p>

<h2>Apple TV</h2>

<p>Apple TV is hot. I only got a brief period to play with it, but it seems fast, responsive, beautiful, and intuitive. It feels alive. If I worked at Apple I’d want to be on that team. On first impression, it is <em>everything</em> I wanted to see. It sounds like a small talented team got to build the Apple TV they wanted to see and use themselves. There is a clarity and vision to the entirety of its design. I think it exemplifies the best of Apple.</p>

<p>The new Apple TV seems great for both video consumption <em>and</em> casual gaming. The MLB At Bat demo during the event was one of the coolest things I&#8217;ve ever seen. Not just because I&#8217;m a baseball fan, but because it presented a revolutionary way to watch live events, period. I think Apple TV might be the most disruptive product from Apple since the iPhone. Not the most lucrative, necessarily, but the most disruptive &#8212; in the sense of defining how all TVs will work in a few years.</p>

<h2>iPhone 6S / 6S Plus</h2>

<p>&#8220;3D Touch&#8221; is the new &#8220;Force Touch&#8221; (Craig Federighi slipped at one point, saying &#8220;force&#8221; before correcting himself.) I&#8217;ve seen concerns that this overcomplicates the iPhone&#8217;s UI design, but I would argue the opposite. It&#8217;s the multi-touch equivalent of keyboard shortcuts on the desktop: shortcuts for tasks that can all be accomplished without it. To use the old parlance, 3D Touch is for power users.</p>

<p>The taptic feedback feels great. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-6s/technology/">Apple calls</a> the two levels &#8220;peek&#8221; and &#8220;pop&#8221;. They definitely feel different. Peek is like the half-press on a camera shutter to auto-focus, and pop is the full-press to take a picture. Pop feels stronger. And, for 3D touch UI elements that only have one level, you feel the pop right away, giving you haptic feedback that you need not try pressing harder, because you&#8217;re already all the way in. The taptic engine also serves as the vibrator for notifications, and I suspect that&#8217;s going to be a big improvement over the rinky-dink vibrator in every iPhone since the iPhone 4.</p>

<p>One small camera bummer: just like last year, optical image stabilization is only available on the Plus. And on the 6S Plus, it&#8217;s even better: OIS now works for video (up to 1080p) in addition to stills &#8212; Apple had a demo video shot while hiking on a trail and it looked really smooth.</p>

<p>I very much liked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBYWGjIzvyw">the iPhone 6S commercial</a>: &#8220;The only thing that&#8217;s changed is everything.&#8221; It head-on addresses the knee-jerk criticism that the 6S/Plus look like last year&#8217;s 6/Plus by showing people using all the new features, all of which are pretty cool.</p>

]]></summary>

<h2>Or: Why I&#8217;m Not Expecting New iPads This Week</h2>

<p>Last year&#8217;s September Apple event &#8212; the big one held at the Flint Center in Cupertino &#8212; had three main segments:</p>

<ol>
<li>iPhone 6 and 6 Plus</li>
<li>Apple Pay</li>
<li>Apple Watch (introduced as a One More Thing, the first without Steve Jobs)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&#8217;s what my gut tells me to expect at tomorrow&#8217;s event, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco:</p>

<ol>
<li>iPhone 6S and 6S Plus</li>
<li>Apple Watch: WatchOS 2.0, third-party apps, new bands and accessories</li>
<li>New Apple TV</li>
</ol>

<p>Conspicuously absent from my guess is anything related to new iPads. I have no sources for this, no hints from any little birdies. This is just my gut feeling, based on Apple&#8217;s event schedule in previous years, and how long I think it will take for Apple to explain and demonstrate the three products above.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going against the grain on this. <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apples-fall-iphone-event-to-be-held-sept-9">John Paczkowski, reporting for Buzzfeed back on 7 August</a>, said the new iPads (but maybe not the big new Pro model) were planned for this event:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like Apple fall events past, this one too will focus on the
company’s next-generation iPhones, which are expected to arrive at
market with a pressure-sensitive Force Touch display, an improved
camera system, and a significantly faster and power-efficient
wireless chip. Sources say Apple executives are likely to show off
the company’s latest iPads at this event as well, though that
12.9-inch “iPad Pro” seems to be a wildcard, still.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then there&#8217;s Mark Gurman. <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/02/ipad-pro-sep-9-ipad-mini-4-november/">Last week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s September 9th event is set to be one of the company’s
largest events in history, as is reflected by the expansive size
of its San Francisco venue. Besides a pair of new iPhones, the
substantially revamped Apple TV set top box, and new bands for the
Apple Watch, Apple is currently planning to debut a pair of new
iPads at next week’s event: the long-rumored iPad Pro, and a
refreshed version of the iPad mini, according to trusted sources…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then again, <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/07/ipad-pro-specs/">just yesterday</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alongside the new iPhones, new Apple TV, new Apple Watch bands,
and a gold anodized version of the Apple Watch Sport, Apple plans
to debut a pair of new iPads on Wednesday: the larger iPad Pro and
a new iPad mini.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gurman and Paczkowski may well be right. But if they are, it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to me, and I&#8217;ll be very curious to figure out why Apple would want to announce all this at once, instead of splitting their fall announcements across two events, a big one in September and a smaller one in October &#8212; just like they have done since 2012.</p>

<p><strong>One Event Scenario</strong>: Everyone agrees that new iPhones and a new Apple TV are set for announcement this week. I would be very surprised if Apple Watch didn&#8217;t get significant stage time as well &#8212; it&#8217;s a major new product heading into its first holiday quarter. The new iPhones are widely expected to have new force touch/taptic engine features &#8212; that&#8217;s the sort of thing that takes significant time to explain and demonstrate on stage. Plus, Apple usually demonstrates all the tentpole features from the soon-to-be-out-of-beta new version of iOS. Yes, they showed us those features back at WWDC &#8212; but they will show them again this fall, because that&#8217;s how it works. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/27/apple-is-about-to-lay-down-its-tv-cards/">The new Apple TV is an <em>altogether new platform</em></a> &#8212; with a radical new remote and a full-on SDK and App Store, with a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/technology/personaltech/new-apple-tv-is-said-to-focus-on-games-challenging-traditional-consoles.html">purported emphasis on gaming</a>. That will necessarily consume a <em>lot</em> of on-stage demo time. If Apple is also going to unveil new iPads, including a major new 13-inch Pro model, that means either the event will run <em>very</em> long, or, some or all of these products will have rushed introductions and not get the time they deserve. And without the iPads being held for an October unveiling, there&#8217;s not enough left for a second event, which means that there will be no on-stage demonstrations or announcements for Mac hardware or OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) this year. It&#8217;s certainly possible that Apple could include the new iPads in this event, but there&#8217;s no way they could do the iPads <em>and</em> Mac/El Capitan all in this one event. Which means no Mac/El Capitan stage time this year.</p>

<p><strong>Two Events Scenario</strong>: iPhones, Apple Watch, new Apple TV this week. That&#8217;s a full event, but not a <em>crowded</em> event. Then we all come back in mid-October for a second event, almost certainly at a smaller venue, where Apple reveals the new iPad lineup, new Mac hardware (like, say, the retina version of the 21-inch iMac) and Craig Federighi gets on stage to demonstrate all the new features in El Capitan. If &#8220;new iPads and Macs&#8221; were worth their own October event last year, why not again this year, when Apple is purportedly set to announce the iPad Pro? Especially given the way that Tim Cook remains staunchly bullish on the iPad&#8217;s long-term prospects, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-31/apple-teams-up-with-cisco-expanding-corporate-sales-push">particularly in the business world</a> &#8212; which, it seems obvious, is going to be a big part of the iPad Pro&#8217;s sales pitch. These new iPads would get more attention headlining their own (albeit smaller) event than they will if they get sandwiched between new iPhones and Apple TV.</p>

<p>It also seems to me that at one of these events, Apple will provide some sort of update on Apple Music. By tradition, that would be the September event, usually with a show-closing live performance (last year was U2). This would leave even <em>less</em> time to shoehorn new iPads into this week&#8217;s event.</p>

<p>Not only does the two-event scenario seem more likely to me, I&#8217;d go so far as to call the one-event scenario inexplicable. Possible, sure. But not logical.</p>

<h2>A Few More Thoughts on the Timing of the iPad Pro</h2>

<p>Again, from <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/02/ipad-pro-sep-9-ipad-mini-4-november/">Gurman&#8217;s post last week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “iPad Pro” (which is actually the planned name of the device)
is currently scheduled to hit retail outlets in November,
following a pre-order campaign that will launch toward the end of
October, sources indicate. While whispers within Apple point to
the MacBook-sized tablet making its debut on next week’s stage,
it is possible that Apple could still hold back the larger iPad
for an early October event given the currently planned November
ship date.</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s not going to be ready to ship to customers until November &#8212; and the whole Asian supply chain rumor mill seems to back that up &#8212; this seems like <em>another</em> reason for Apple to wait until October to announce it, no? Occasionally, such as with the original iPhone and last year&#8217;s Apple Watch, Apple will unveil a new product months ahead of it hitting stores. But the iPhone and Apple Watch were brand new product categories. That doesn&#8217;t feel like something Apple would want to do with a new product model in an existing category like the iPad Pro.</p>

<p>Again, I could be wrong, and perhaps it will all be clear to me tomorrow, but as it stands right now, I don&#8217;t see why Apple would unveil new iPads at this event.</p>

<h2>About the Venue</h2>

<p>The Bill Graham Civic Auditorium <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bill+graham+civic+auditorium+inside&amp;tbm=isch&amp;gws_rd=ssl">is enormous</a>, with a seating capacity of up to 7,000. Last year&#8217;s September event venue, the Flint Center, has a capacity of around 2,400. That doesn&#8217;t mean Apple is going to fill the place with anywhere close to 7,000 people, though. Anecdotally, talking to friends, it seems like press passes for the event are relatively tight &#8212; and they&#8217;re certainly not loose. It&#8217;s possible that Apple is inviting scores of people from industries where I don&#8217;t have contacts (like gaming and Hollywood), but even then, I can&#8217;t see the number of invitees expanding that much compared to last year. (And last year&#8217;s event had a slew of invitees from the fashion and watch industries.)</p>

<p>Remember that <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/08/28/apple-flint-center-structure-iphone-6/">white pop-up building</a> Apple built outside the Flint Center last year? It was a big hands-on area for all the new stuff that had been announced that day. My guess is that Apple is building something similar again this year &#8212; <em>inside</em> the auditorium. It would be like the world&#8217;s biggest Apple Store, for one day only.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Some post-publication comments from readers:</p>

  <p>On @gruber’s piece:</p>

<ol>
<li>The only thing I heard is that iPad was happening, at least
last week</li>
<li>Big TVs need space</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting that he heard iPads were coming this week.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/eslivka/status/641350137277579264">Eric Slivka</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@viticci @gruber Best argument for announcing iPad Pro tomorrow is
to give devs more time to optimize for new size and features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That actually does make some sense. But last year, Apple did not announce the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus early to give developers time to adapt. Apple expects developers to be doing the right thing, with size classes and etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dominocollege/status/641350460452921344">Chad Edward</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@gruber Just listened to your show. Don’t you think Apple would
have had a controlled leak by now of no iPad Pro? Like no Apple TV
at WWDC?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, since so many people now expect iPads tomorrow, would not Apple leak the fact that there aren&#8217;t &#8212; if I&#8217;m right that there aren&#8217;t &#8212; to the NYT or WSJ or Bloomberg?</p>

<p>They might! The fact that no one claiming &#8220;sources familiar with the matter&#8221; has yet said otherwise is probably the best sign that I&#8217;m wrong. But, there&#8217;s a big difference between Apple TV missing WWDC and the iPads missing this week. After June, the next event was tomorrow&#8217;s, three months away. After tomorrow, the next event, if there is a second fall event, is only a month away. And there&#8217;s plenty of Apple news to fill that month:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS 9.0 ships to customers next week.</li>
<li>Reviews of the new iPhones (and maybe Apple TV?) will drop next week.</li>
<li>Pre-orders for iPhones and Apple TV will start next Friday at midnight PT.</li>
<li>People will start getting their new iPhones later in the month. Maybe they&#8217;ll start getting their new Apple TVs too.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll start hearing about developers making cool apps and games for Apple TV.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next thing you know, it&#8217;ll be mid-October and we&#8217;ll see the new iPads. If I&#8217;m right. If I&#8217;m wrong, I guess we&#8217;ll see them tomorrow.</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AOL/TechCrunch&#8217;s Jon Evans tries to argue that, in the name of security and privacy, Apple should stop its efforts to close jailbreaking exploits.</p>

<p>Jon Evans, in a piece for AOL/TechCrunch headlined &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/22/dont-be-apple/">Don&#8217;t Be Apple</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is so much to admire about Apple. They make superb,
beautiful products. Their amazing comeback story is unparalleled
in corporate history. [&#8230;] So why do I think they represent so
much of what’s wrong with the tech world? It’s because they have,
I think, an almost Shakespearean tragic flaw: their obsession with
centralized corporate control of the devices they sell. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>What could go wrong? Well, let’s get dystopically speculative for
a moment. Can you remember some of the most hyperbolic
overreactions to the fall of the World Trade Center, and how they
were welcomed by large swathes of the American public? Can you
imagine a future in which, following a similar tragedy, Apple
rolls over and becomes a de facto arm of surveillance states? I
sure can &#8212; and Apple’s centralized-command-and-control ecosystem
would make it worryingly easy to turn every iOS device into an eye
and ear of the panopticon, more or less overnight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At which point we&#8217;d be forced to continue using these spyware Apple products because… ? And engineers at Apple would continue working for the company rather than resigning en masse because… ? And Apple would suffer no bad publicity for its cowardice because… ? Because: Tim Cook could surely flip a switch that would enable this surveillance without anyone noticing.</p>

<p>This advice is madness. Evans is recommending against using a platform that is secure and private today, from a company with a consistent decades-long track record in this regard, because in the future they might turn coat and become an accomplice of government mass surveillance, even though, if that came to pass, we could and would all just abandon the use of Apple products.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can aim similar criticisms at Android, too, but they would
miss the mark. Love it or hate it, Android is not near [<em>sic</em>] as
centralized as iOS, and Google is not nearly as controlling as
Apple. It’s open-source, and major organizations can &#8212; and do &#8212; fork
it to create their own independent versions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parts of Android are indeed open source &#8212; &#8220;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/">except for all the good parts</a>&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple fights an ongoing war with iOS jailbreakers, claiming that
their work is &#8220;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/07/feds-ok-iphone-jailbreaking/">potentially catastrophic</a>&#8221;; Google makes it
especially easy to root Nexus devices. [&#8230;]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Glenn Fleishman, writing for Macworld last month, &#8220;<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2944712/hacking-team-hack-reveals-why-you-shouldnt-jailbreak-your-iphone.html">Hacking Team Hack Reveals Why You Shouldn&#8217;t Jailbreak Your iPhone</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A massive breach in the private data of a firm that sells software
to governments to spy on communications shows that jailbroken
iPhones are vulnerable. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Two security outfits &#8212; the commercial Kaspersky Lab in Russia and
academic Citizen Lab in Canada &#8212; first revealed in June 2014 that
they had discovered and decoded Hacking Team’s smartphone-cracking
software. The reports at that time indicated that only jailbroken
iOS devices could be hijacked, but that malware could be installed
on an iOS device when connected to a computer that was confirmed
as trusted, and which had been compromised.</p>

<p>That external analysis has now been complemented by the Hacking
Team’s internal documents. One price list shows a €50,000
($56,000) price tag on an iOS snooping module with the note,
“Prerequisite: the iOS device must be jailbroken.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple works to close jailbreaking exploits because they <em>are</em> potentially catastrophic.</p>

<p>Back to Evans:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It may seem silly to criticize a fantastic company that makes
superb products and delights its users on the basis of an abstract
philosophical dispute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even the most jacktastic article usually has one true sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I have a sneaking suspicion that over the next year this
dispute will grow more and more concrete. Maybe, as this contrast
heightens, Apple will see the light; maybe instead of fighting
jailbreakers, they will offer jailbreaking and sideloading as an
option for power users out of the box, just as Android does. That
alone would be a huge seismic shift.</p>

<p>But I’m not holding my breath. And until and unless that happens,
I find it hard to recommend the iOS ecosystem in good conscience,
despite its power and beauty, because Apple refuses to return any
of the trust it demands from its users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let&#8217;s get this straight: Jon Evans is deeply concerned about a hypothetical dystopic fantasy scenario where Apple turns a 180, abandons all of the privacy principles the company has adhered to for decades and has <a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/">prominently promoted as a competitive advantage</a>, and begins cooperating with the U.S. government to surveil iOS users. To alleviate his concerns, Evans wants Apple to stop its efforts to close jailbreaking exploits, and in the meantime, he can&#8217;t &#8220;recommend the iOS ecosystem in good conscience&#8221;. This, despite the fact that in the actual world, today, we know for a fact from the Hacking Team data breach that various governments around the world &#8212; including Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan, Azerbaijan, and Turkey &#8212; have been sold software that allows them to snoop on iOS devices, but <em>only if the devices have been jailbroken</em>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure iOS users want Apple to get right on this.</p>
